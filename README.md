# SeaTable Scripts 

> [Warnning] This is not the code used for the `production level', please pay attention to some of the differences when using it in your environment.

## Introduction

From May 2024, carefully study the script usage of seatable, and record some sample code of seatable script and examples of various scenarios here;

Initially, it was for the convenience of subsequent dictionary lookup and to make it easier for everyone to experience; currently, we will mainly use Python code as an example.

## Source of information

All code examples and reference materials are from the open materials of seatable:

- [SeaTable Programming manual](https://seatable.github.io/seatable-scripts-cn/)
- [github.com/seatable/seatable-scripts-cn](https://github.com/seatable/seatable-scripts-cn)
- [SeaTable Forums](https://forum.seatable.io/)
- Support staff for SeaTable's enterprise support

> If you have other channels, you are welcome to share.

## Project structure

The main project information is as follows:

```bash
- docs/       # Mainly sharing and introducing some help documents.
- scripts/python/    # The location where Python scripts are stored, using files to distinguish each script's content.
- scripts/javascripts/  # Javascripts
```

Through the document richness of SeaTable and the feedback of support personnel, SeaTable's support for Python scripts is more abundant than JavaScripts.

## Open Source Agreement

**All code you can use at any time, without obtaining anyone's consent. You only need to be responsible for yourself and don't worry about any restrictions.**
